# CloudFormation template for an AWS Active Directory Connector.
# ****** IMPORTANT ******
# This Starter-Kit is an add-on to the Windows Migration Starter-Kit. Deployment will fail if there is no 
# Windows Migration Starter-Kit deployed. Ensure that you are in the correct AWS region before attempting to deploy
# this Starter-Kit. In addition, before deploying this stack:
#
# - run the Helper-Script "Utility-Prepare-AD-Connector" in the Helper-Scripts folder on Domain Controller 1
# - create an AD user for the AD COnnector connection
# - add that user to the AwsConnectors security group that was created by the "Utility-Prepare-AD-Connector" helper script.
# - Ensure that the AD user has a passowrd setting of "Password Never Expires". Pro tip: Put the user in it's own Organization Unit in AD
#   and apply a Group Policy Object to that OU to disable password expiry and rotation only for that user. 
#
# When deploying this stack. the user name and password of the AD user in the AwsConnectors group is required. 
#
# AD Connector is required for certain AWS services to integrate with your EC2-based Windows Active Directory, such as Amazon 
# WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, and Amazon Simple Email Service. The use of certain AWS Services such as WorkSpaces
# may make AD Connector a free feature as long as the other services are deployed IN THIS ACCOUNT. For more information, refer to the
# AWS Documentation on Directory COnnector and the corresponsing service.
#
# An AD Connector can take up to 30 minutes to deploy. Because of this, there is no wait handler. CloudFormation will assume that the directory 
# is created successfully and return a SUCCESS message. If the AD Connector fails to deploy, i.e. if an incorrect AD password is provided, you 
# may delete the CloudFormation stack if the AD Connector is in a Failed state in the Directory Service console.
# 
# This Starter-Kit template deploys all AWS components required to deploy an AD Connector for your self managed windows AD Domain.
# It deploys the following:
#   - A Secret in Secrets Manager where your domain join account is encrypted and stored securly. 
#   - AD Connector that connects to an existing EC2-based AD (Deployed by Windows-Migration-Starter-Kit)
#     - AD Connector in turn creates 2 ENI's in your VPC to communicate with your AD DC's
#     - AD Connector also creates a Security Group to allow communication between your AD DC and the Directory Conneector Service
#
# This template exports outputs to facilitate easy additions of future services or components such as additional servers, VDI (WorkSpaces), Database, etc. 
# It is recommended that these values are NOT changed in any way. 
#
# After deletion, you may have to manually delete the elastic network interfaces that were created (these have a description of "AWS created network interface for 
# directory") and delete the security group (it will have a name of directory-id-controllers). Delete the CloudWatch logs group (ad-connector-log-group) and delete
# the data-redaction-audit-logs. After those items are deleted you may be able to re-deploy the stack.
#
# For more details, refer to the Deployment Guide and Troubleshooting Guide.
#

# AWS Content or Third-Party Content under the AWS Customer Agreement, or the relevant written agreement between you and AWS
