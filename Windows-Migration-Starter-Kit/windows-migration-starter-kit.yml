# *** YOU MUST DEPLOY THE AZMAPPER STACK IN CLOUDFORMATION PRIOR TO DEPLOYING THIS STACK OR STACK DEPLOYMENT WILL FAIL. *** 
# 
# *** NOTICE FOR WORKSPACES COMPATIBILITY *** 
# It is recommended that you deploy this template only in regions which support WorkSpaces. This template will deploy the stack in any 
# AWS region; however, you will not be able to add WorkSpaces if the stack is deployed in a region that does not support WorkSpaces.
# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/azs-workspaces.html for more information.
#
# This Starter Kit template deploys all AWS components required to run a Migrated Windows Domain in AWS in accordance with the Well-Architected Framework. 
#  It deploys the following:
#  - VPC with 1 Public Subnet and 4 Private Subnets across 2 Availability Zones for Resiliency
#  - All Route Tables 
#  - Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) for each subnet
#  - NAT Gateway
#  - Internet Gateway
#  - VPN Tunnel from on-premise to the VPC
#  - 2 EC2 Windows Domain Controllers
#  - 1 EC2 Windows File Server with File Server Storage configurable to 50GB, 100GB, 250GB (Default), 500GB or 1TB.
#  - Security Groups which secure the EC2 Windows Instances to least privilege
#  - Generated helper scripts which automate the migration of Active Directory and the File Server from on-prem to the new VPC-based servers
#  - A Backup plan which backs up all servers in a 30 day hourly and 12 month monthly rotation
#  - A Backup Vault where the backups are stored
#  - A CloudWatch Performance Dashboard which monitors VPN Tunnel and basic server health
#  - KMS Key for encryption of Cloudwatch alarms at rest and required security policy to manage and use the key
#  - CloudWatch Alarms which monitor for critical conditions which require immediate action and notify you via email 
#  - A SNS Topic which notifies you via email when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (You must confirm subscription to the topic from the email confirmation)
#  - Basic Setup of Systems Manager to enable RDP Access to the Windows Servers from the AWS Console 
#
#  In most cases, the default IPv4 addressing and EC2 instance naming convention should not interfere with on-prem addresses and machine names. 
#  It is recommended that these settings are reviewed before deployment. See Deployment Guide for details. 
#
#  This template exports outputs to facilitate easy additions of future services or components such as additional servers, VDI (WorkSpaces), Database, etc. 
#  It is recommended that these values are NOT changed in any way. 
#
#  If you wish to delete this Starter Kit, you must delete the backup jobs in the backup vault first (or delete the entire vault). After deletion, you can delete any CloudWatch 
#  log groups created by this Starter Kit. DELETING THIS STACK WILL DELETE ALL RESOURCES WITHOUT ANY CHANCE OF RESTORATION. USE THE POWER OF THE DELETE BUTTON 
#  WITH EXTREME CAUTION. 
#
# YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A PATCH MANAGEMENT SOLUTION. Many MSP's already have a favored RMM solution that they integrate into
# cloud deployments and this Starter Kit will work with any RMM. If you do not have an RMM, Systems Manager has a free Patch management tool which is easy to use.
# A Starter Kit add-on to add Systems Manager Patch Manager to this kit is on the development roadmap.
#
# For more details, refer to the Deployment Guide and Troubleshooting Guide.
#
# Sample code, software libraries, command line tools, proofs of concept, templates, or other related technology are provided as 
# AWS Content or Third-Party Content under the AWS Customer Agreement, or the relevant written agreement between you and AWS
# (whichever applies). You are responsible for testing, securing, and optimizing the AWS Content or Third-Party Content, such as 
# sample code, as appropriate for production grade use based on your specific quality control practices and standards. Deploying AWS 
# Content or Third-Party Content may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS chargeable resources, such as running Amazon EC2 
# instances or using Amazon S3 storage.

# Line 20 creates a Helper-Scripts directory in the root of C: that holds all of the automation scripts.
# Line 21 creates the helper script that joins the computer to the domain.
# Line 22 creates the helper script which adds the AD Domain Services role and promotes the domain controller.

# Line 24 creates the helper script which tests replication and prints out the results to a txt file.
# Line 25 renames the computer to the computer name parameter and restarts Windows.

# Lines 1-19 assign the private IP address, netmask, default gateway and DNS servers to the ethernet interface in Windows. Required in Windows for Domain controllers to be able to promote.
# Line 20 creates a Helper-Scripts directory in the root of C: that holds all of the automation scripts.
# Line 21 creates the helper script which joins the computer to the domain.
# Line 22 creates the helper script that installs the file server roles on the server.

# Line 30 renames and restarts the computer.
# The instances have additional tags which are specific to AWS backup, allowing customization of backup plan based on backup role if the customer requires additional
