Included in the setup is the VPC networking, Network ACLs, Virtual Machines, Security Groups, a Site to Site VPN Tunnel, Dashboard, Alarms, and Backup Jobs. All of this is deployed automatically for you. In addition, each EC2 instance contains automation scripts that automate the migration of Active Directory and the file server at the click of a button.
